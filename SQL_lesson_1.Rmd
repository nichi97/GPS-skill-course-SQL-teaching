## Introduction | Our Scenario Today

We are running a bookstore collectively (just like the left-wing leaning bookstore on campus
**The Groundwork Books!**). How do you manage your book inventory? 

- What are some **common operations** that you want to do to your inventory? (CRUD)
- What are some **tool(s)** that you can think of to support your operation on the inventory?
- With these tool(s), what are some **problems** that might emerge in the foreseeable future?

Using database and database management system, many of these concerns will be addressed.

Note: These problems and solutions are generalizable.

<div class = "notes">
* CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete
* Tools - Google sheet, excel, Notion
* Limitations: 
  * Update - Manual work, error prone. (The inventory is still a mess)
  * Read - not efficient (customer ask if we have a book)
  * Delete - on no
</div>

## Introduction | Database related concepts 

- **Database**: Shared collection of related data used to support the activities of
a particular organization.
- **Database Management System(DBMS)**: Programs that support CRUD operations and control
all access to databases.
  - Provide an environment that is both **convenient** and **efficient** for
  users to retrieve and store information
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language - language used to talk to DBMS

## Introduction | Formalized Motivation

- **Automation**. Interface linking to other programs
- **Summary Statistics**. Help you generate the report 
- **Enforcement of Integrity constraints**. Rules to constraints that users
enter valid information (**data type!**)
- **Multiuser system**. Control for access, data sharing 
  - e.g. Read and write, read-only
- **Backup and recovery facilities**. 


## Data model | A bird-eye view of our data

```{r include=F}
books <- read_csv("data/books.csv")
books <- books %>% mutate(ISBN13 = as.character(ISBN13))
customers <- read_csv("data/customers.csv")
transactions <- read_csv("data/transactions.csv")
```
```{r echo=T}
books
```
---

```{r echo=T}
customers
```
---
```{r echo=T}
transactions
```

- Bullet 3

<div class="notes">

This is my *note*

- it can contain markdown
- like this
</div>

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
